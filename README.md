# gonectr

`gonectr` is a command-line tool tailored for creating and managing [Gone](https://github.com/gone-io/gone) projects. It provides functionality for generating code, compiling, and running Gone projects efficiently.

## Installation

To install `gonectr`, run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/gone-io/gonectr@latest
```

This will install `gonectr` into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is included in your `$PATH` to use `gonectr` globally.

## Usage

### 1. Create a New Gone Project

You can create a new Gone project using:

```bash
gonectr create my-gone-project
```

This initializes a new Gone project directory named `my-gone-project`.

### 2. Generate Helper Code for Gone Project

Helper code files generated by `gonectr` typically end with `.gone.go`. Itâ€™s recommended to add `*.gone.go` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid versioning these generated files.

To generate helper code and learn more about its usage, run:

```bash
gonectr generate -h
```

### 3. Generate Priest Function Code

This command generates Priest function code, a feature adapted from [gone tools](https://github.com/gone-io/gone/tree/feature/1.x/tools/gone).

To learn more, run:

```bash
gonectr priest -h
```

### 4. Generate Mock Code for Interfaces

This command generates mock code for interfaces, which is useful for testing. It requires the `mockgen` tool. To install `mockgen`, run:

```bash
go install go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@latest
```

To learn more, run:

```bash
gonectr mock -h
```

### 5. Build a Gone Project

The `build` command first runs `gonectr generate ...` to create any necessary helper code, then builds the project using `go build`.

To learn more, run:

```bash
gonectr build -h
```

### 6. Run a Gone Project

The `run` command generates helper code (if needed) before running the project with `go run`.

To learn more, run:

```bash
gonectr run -h
```
